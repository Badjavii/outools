# Outools Project

As is well known, every programming language has its own data input/output modules. However, most of these modules present numerous problems. That's why the Outools Project was created.

The Outools Project was born from the idea of modernizing the input/output modules of programming languages in order to add new features. The goal is for every language to include Outools as a standard library.

For now, young developers have the responsibility to give it a try and add it to their high school projects to popularize the use of the tools offered.

## What Outools includes:

- **Color code dictionary:** Reserved words are defined for each color using their respective ANSI code.

- **Output module with special characters:** This module allows you to print data output with special characters such as accents. It changes the terminal encoding to UTF-8 to accomplish this task. You can also print messages in color using the dictionary.

- **Typewriter-effect output module:** This module has the same functions as the previous module, but prints data with a character delay of the desired length.

- **Validated input module:** You specify the type of data you expect and the variable that will store that data. Example: an integer is expected, and the user enters a string. Consequently, the module ensures that the program doesn't crash and displays an error message without halting execution.

- **Terminal pause and clear modules:** One module is used to pause the execution of a program in the terminal. The other allows you to clear data that has been printed in the terminal.

## How to use Outools

- You can browse the repository, searching for the language you're interested in, copying the code, and pasting it into your project as a library.

- You can download a copy of the repository locally to your machine using the command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Badjavii/outools.git
```

It's worth mentioning that to use Outools, you need to do your own research on how to use custom libraries in the programming language you're interested in. You can search Google for: *how to use custom libraries in [name of programming language]*.

## Responsibility and reference for use at the institutional level

Ooutols tools meet highly demanded needs in the development field for core subjects at educational institutions. Therefore, students are advised to carefully read the documentation to understand the tools' logic. You should also consult with your tutor about the rules for using external libraries, such as including the reference to the repository to which the code belongs, etc.

## Availability

Outools is currently available for:

- C/C++
- Java

Work is underway to ensure that the Outools Project is available in as many programming languages as possible.
